In this repo, I will implement some NLP models for the nlp beginner learner. In each project folder contains a notebook floder to show the output in detail. I think this would help the beginner to understand what happens in the model.

I will list what resource used for each model implementation. All project based on Python3.6 and Keras2.1.6 with TensorFlow1.8 backend.


## Deep Models for NLP beginners

You can find detail instruction in each project.
